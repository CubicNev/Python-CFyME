## Brief Introduction

### Zen de Python

Filosofía sobre la que se contruye Python. Se empieza importando `this` (sin albur)

```python
import this
```

Al hacerlo se nos desplegará lo siguiente:

> **The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters**
> Beatiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> Simple is better than complex.
> Complex better than complicated
> Flat is better than nested.
> Sparse is better than dense.
> Readability counts.
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
> Although practically beats purity.
> Error should never pass silenty.
> Unless explicity silenced.
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the tempetion to guess.
> There should be one-- **and freferably only one** --obvious way to do it.
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
> Now is better than never.
> Although never is often better than *right* now.
> If the implemetation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> If the implemetation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> Namespaces are one honking great ida -- let's do more of that --
